I took your CX4640 Numerical Analysis in Fall 2017 and finished with an A. I will be applying to Georgia Tech's MSCS program starting in Fall 2019 through the fast-track option.

> I'm planning to specialize in Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Graphics, and I believe that numerical methods are quite useful when it comes to computer graphics and computer vision. My supervisor at my last internship will write about my ability a UI developer, but I still need someone to attest to my technical/mathematical competence to pursue graduate study in computer graphics. I have expressed my concerns about lacking an adequate mathematical background when I took your class but I made an extra effort and managed to make it to the top of the class. In the latter half of the course I tried my best to complete all the extra-credit problems even though I didn't need them to improve my grade. I was hoping that maybe you could include in your recommendation the hard-working attitude and mathematical maturity that I demonstrated during the course.

> The application is not due until the drop day of Spring 2019, but I'm planning to submit the application by early October this year. If this sounds agreeable to you, I'll submit the recommendation request on the application website. I believe the website will then send an email to you asking for the letter.

And in case you might be interested, while I was looking for online materials for that part, I came across Einstein's original paper (the 1916 review paper where the theory was finalized), and it was surprisingly readable. There was no modern mathematics involved (so zero topology), and the paper was intended for people with a minimal math background (I would say multivariable calculus and Lagrangian mechanics are the only prerequisites). I really wanted to recommend it to someone, but I don't know anyone else who might be interested.

> I'm a 4th year CS major, and I'm considering adding the Physics minor. Who should I contact to get the signature? Also, is it possible to substitute a course in relativity (4147 or 7125) for 2213? I was previously a Physics major and I only need 2213 to fulfill the requirements for a minor. However, I just saw that there are still seats available in 7125 this semester (I have not confirmed that I'm permitted to take the class though), and the meeting times are the same as 2213. I have always wanted to take a class in relativity (I have tried to enroll in 4147 twice in the past, but had to drop both times due to conflicts with my major courses (I then took differential geometry instead) and also I was working off-campus last time 7125 was offered) so I'm wondering if this time I could use 7125 to satisfy the 2213 requirement, as I'm really hoping to finish my college career with no regrets but I also don't want to delay my graduation for an extra class that doesn't count towards my major or minor.

> Hi Prof. Shoemaker,
>
> I'm a 4th year CS student minoring in physics. I saw that there are seats available in PHYS 7125, so I'm wondering if I'll be able to register for the class. I was planning to take 4147 the previous two fall semesters, but unfortunately they conflicted with my major courses. I recently came across the 7125 website and read a few lecture notes out of curiosity and found I was able to follow lots of the contents, but I also noted that the graduate level classical mechanics and EM courses are listed as prerequisites and my knowledge certainly has not reached that level. So I'm wondering how much material from those two courses are involved and whether this class is out of reach for me. Here is my background: (I apologize for the long email)
>
> - I was previously a Physics major, but I have not taken 2213 or learned SR outside of class. I've only had Classical I (3201), Quantum I (3143), Electrostatics (3122) and Thermodynamics (3141). I did pretty well (grade-wise, maybe not a reliable indicator) on the first three, but was completely lost on thermo (despite getting a good grade). I've read a little bit about Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics as I was preparing to take Classical II, before I switched to CS. That was several years ago so I most likely have forgotten 90% of the stuff. 
> - I took PDE last semester (for whatever reason), and there I happened to meet a classmate who had taken 4147 so I borrowed and browsed through the notes, which helped a lot. I've also been reading intermittently about tensor calculus and attempted to read (and did finish reading) one of Einstein's original papers on GR. So the subject is not entirely foreign to me.
> - I also took the undergraduate differential geometry last semester. Sadly it was about the classical theory, but our professor did throw in quite a few Riemannian concepts, so I was fortunate enough to be exposed to metric tensors, Christoffel symbols, covariant derivatives and the Riemann curvature tensor and such.
> - (I have also watched plenty of video lectures by a German guy called Friedrich Schuller on Youtube and found those way too abstract for me)
>
> Sorry again for the lengthy email. I'm graduating soon so I just want to make sure I make the most out of the remaining time and have no regrets when I close this chapter.
